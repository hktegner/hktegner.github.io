If you're interested in computers or technlogy, you will know where it's from. Technology is often driven by brilliant visionary people, but sometimes those people people get it very very wrong. The quotes below illustrate what I mean.

Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corp., 1977:
> "There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home." 

Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943:
> "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."

Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, 1981:
> "640K ought to be enough for anybody."

Okay, I admit the last quote has not been confirmed, and Bill Gates strenuously objects to ever having said it, but it's highly likely that many have uttered similar statements. Considering the speed of developments over the last few decades, it's easy to forgive such blunders.
