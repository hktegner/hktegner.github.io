__Few memories from my childhood__, are as vivid as when I as a teenage boy got my hands on my first computer - an AT 286 with 640KB of memory and a screen with 255 shades of amber. Countless hours were spent in front of that computer, firstly learning to program it, playing games on it, and then later on connecting it to bulletin board systems - the pre-cursor to the internet. Fond memories!

__Not all my first encounters__ with technology were filled with such bliss. At first, mobile phones annoyed me no end. The ringtones annoyed me and the behaviour of people with mobile phones annoyed me. I vowed never to get one! And, then I got one. It was a Nokia 6100. Good sound quality and battery life, but boring. The next phone I bought was a smartphone, and this time I was hooked.

__I was born before TV invaded every home__, listened to my fathers Queen records on a record player, and was taught on a blackboard in school. These days music and TV is streamed from the internet, smartphones are glued to peoples faces, and virtually every car has a satellite navigation system. The internet is pervasive and all the information in the world is at our finger tips. Exciting times. I can't wait to see what comes next.
