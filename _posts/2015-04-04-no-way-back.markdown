__When Neo took that red pill__, there was no way back up that rabbit hole. And when Adam had a bite of that apple, the knowledge he gained changed his world forever. You may think it's funny that I mention those two stories together, but for me they are about the same thing. They are about the loss of innocence and the fact that sometimes when we learn something new, that knowledge can cause us some grief.

__I was reminded of this the other day.__ That time of the year had finally come 'round again. It was getting too cold in the house and it was time to turn on and re-program the central heating. Ugh...! Now, this may not seem like a big deal to you, but being a gadget man I'm interested in home automation and know exactly how simple and convenient this could be. I should be able to do this from the comfort of my living room or in fact from anywhere in the world with a minute to spare. Using a mobile phone I should be able to open an app and make a single change to switch the central heating program from summer to winter mode. And then I should be able to get on with my life!

__Instead of using a slick home automation app__, I need to squeeze myself into a cupboard in the bedroom where the hot water and central heating control panel is. Then I need to change the central heating program using three multi-function keys. They are labelled 'Set?', 'Yes/-', '+'. Navigating to the central heating program for Mon-Fri involves pressing 'Set?' twice and then 'Yes/-' once to enter setup mode and to select central heating. Then 'Yes/-' again to setup the Mon-Fri program. Then a mix of 'Set?' and 'Yes/-' and '+' to adjust three on/off time intervals. Each press of the 'Yes/-' and '+' buttons adjust the time by a minute, keep it pressed to make it more in 10 minute increments. I think you get the gist.

__Ignorance is bliss (sometimes) isn't it?!__ Re-programming the central heating used to illicit a sense of accomplishment. Now, because I know how simple it could be, it is a source of consternation and annoyance. Perhaps it's finally time to invest some money in home automation? Oh well, it's done now. Maybe next year...
