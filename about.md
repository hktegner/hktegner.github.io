Welcome to my site! Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet.
Your "reward" is a little info about me.

I was born in South-Korea, raised by Norwegians, educated by Scots, working in England, once married to an Indian, now happily settled with a Romanian. Interested in most things under the sun, but particularly all things technological.

What else? I'm an optimist, lover of musicals and maker of lists. Below are some more of 'my favourite things'.
