Welcome to my site! Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the galaxy.
Here's a little info about me.

I was born in South-Korea, raised by Norwegians, educated by Scots, working in England, once married to an Indian, now happily settled with a Romanian. Interested in most things under the sun, but particularly all things technological.

What else? I'm an avid list maker - mostly of things I need to do or remember,
but below are a few lists of 'my favourite things'.
